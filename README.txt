This sound bank has been created from real instrument recordings, thanks to Xavimart (Javier), a musician that maintains a collection of musical instruments from many places around the world. He granted us access to his collection and helped with the performance and recording.

Caj贸n flamenco, bongo, egg shaker, tambourine, castanets, maracas and darbuka: Recorded on January 2019 by Xavimart, Gonzalo <humanogonzalo@gmail.com> and Roberto <roberto@zenvoid.org>, with two Zoom H1 portable recorders.

Hand clap: Recorded on June 2019 by Roberto, with an AKG condenser microphone.

Claves and conga: Made from samples of the Versilian Community Sample Library, a CC0 sample library created by Versilian Studios LLC.

Raw recordings were cropped, edited, and processed by Roberto, using free software programs. Future versions of this sound bank may contain more instruments.
